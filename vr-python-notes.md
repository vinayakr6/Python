## Python
- Python is high level general purpose programming language used for various applications such as to build websites, software applications, to build mobile applications, to automate tasks, in Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning and data analysis, game development etc.

## Python Operators
## 1. Arthimetic operators
- Addition (`+`): Adds the operands 
  - ```python
    >>> 5 + 5
    10
    >>> 58 + 36
    94
    ```
- Substraction (`-`): Substracts the operands
  - ```python
    >>> 10 - 6
    4
    >>> 25 - 30
    -5
    ```
- Multiplication (`*`): Multiplies the operands
  - ``` python
    >>> 5 * 6 
    30
    >>> 12 * 3
    36
    ```
- Division (`/`): divides the operands and gives the output in floating point number.
  - ``` python
    >>> 30 / 6 
    5.0
    >>> 13 * 4
    3.25
    ```
## Programs
1. Program to find the average of Max 2 numbers out of three.
