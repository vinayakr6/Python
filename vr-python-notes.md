# PYTHON
## Introduction
- Python is high level general purpose programming language used for various applications such as to build websites, software applications, to build mobile applications, to automate tasks, in Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning and data analysis, game development etc.
- It is an object-oriented, high-level programming language with built-in data structures and dynamic semantics.

- **Why to learn python** 
1. Ease of use: Simple syntax, easy to understand and learn
2. Active Community: large community to help with errors/issues 
3. Portable and Extensible: code developed is compatible with any of the non-native platforms and also can be integrated with Java, C/C++ libraries or .Net Components.
4. Testing frameworks: Many built-in testing frameworks to help in debugging and speeding up workflows. Tools/Framework supported by python - Selenium(run test scripts to automate tasks), pytest(functional, integrational and unit testing), splinter(for testing web applications, automates visiting URL's and iteractimng with items)
5. Libraries and Packages: Has a rabge of libraries, packagages, frameworks and modules for data manipulation, statistical calculation, web development, machine learning and data science. Python opackage index repository of python software.
6. Scripting and automation: Used for writing scripts and automating tasks without human intervention.
7. Web Development: Wide collection of frameworks(Django, flask, pyramid, turbo gears, cherry pie and more) that make it easier for developers to develop web applications. 
8. Machine Learning: 
9. Data Science: 
10. Career Opporutunities and Salary: 
- **Popular open source projects**
  - PipENV, Chatistics, Travelling Salesman Problem using Self-organizing maps and python to BPF converter
- **Popular GitHub repositories**
  - NLP, ML-From-Scratch, Pytorch-Transformers, 100-Days Of ML Code
## Python Operators
## 1. Arthimetic operators
- Addition (`+`): Adds the operands 
  - ```python
    >>> 5 + 5
    10
    >>> 58 + 36
    94
    ```
- Substraction (`-`): Substracts the operands
  - ```python
    >>> 10 - 6
    4
    >>> 25 - 30
    -5
    ```
- Multiplication (`*`): Multiplies the operands
  - ``` python
    >>> 5 * 6 
    30
    >>> 12 * 3
    36
    ```
- Division (`/`): divides the operands and gives the output in floating point number.
  - ``` python
    >>> 30 / 6 
    5.0
    >>> 13 * 4
    3.25
    ```
  
## Decision Control Statements
1. Selection or Conditional brranching statements
   - if statement
   - if-else statement
   - nested if statement
   - if elif else statement
2. Basic loop structures or iterative statements
   - while loop
   - for loop
3. Nested loops
4. Break statement
5. Continue statement
6. Pass statement
7. else statement used with loops
  
### Conditional statements
1. If statement
   Syntax:
   ``` python
   if condition:
      statement 1
      statement 2
      ...
      statement n
    statement outside of if statement
    ```
- Example 1: Program to take number from the user and find is it even number. [click here](Programs/evennumber.py) 
- Output:
    ```python
    Enter the number: 24
    The number is even
    ```
- Example 2: Program to take number from the user and increment it by 5. [click here](Programs/increment.py)
- Output:
  ``` python
  Enter the number: 45
  50
  ```

## Programs
1. Program to find the average of Max 2 numbers out of three.
  - [Max2_out_of_three](Programs/max_2_out_of_2.py)
  - ![Flowchart](assests/max_2_out_of_3.png)
